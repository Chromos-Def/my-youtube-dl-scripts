Three batch scripts to update youtube-dl, download an audio .mp3 or a video in the .mkv format.

# Get things setup
- Grab the three .bat files from here
- Make a folder of your name choice and toss these three batch scripts into it and place said folder anywhere you wish.
- Download **youtube-dl.exe** listed under **Assests** from the **Latest release** listed here
     - https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/releases (this is the official github for youtube-dl)
- Now place youtube-dl into the same folder you created from the first step.
- Next we need to get **ffmpeg** so youtube-dl can do the magical thing of downloading audio and video.
