     - Download **youtube-dl.exe** listed under **Assests** from the **Latest release**
     - Now place youtube-dl.exe into the same folder you created from the first step.
- Next we need to get **ffmpeg** so youtube-dl can do the magical thing of downloading audio and video.
- Get ffmpeg from here https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/
     - Download the latest release under **version** to ensure stability. *Hover over the versions to read more on them*
